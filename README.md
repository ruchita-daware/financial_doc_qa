# ðŸ§  FinDocs AI: Financial Document Q&A with Streamlit + Ollama

## Project Overview
This project allows you to run a **Large Language Model (LLM)** locally using **Ollama** to answer questions from financial PDF documents. 
All functionality is consolidated into a **single Python file (`app.py`)**, making it easy to set up and use.

## Features
- Upload financial PDFs and extract text.
- Split text into chunks and build embeddings using Ollama.
- Ask questions about the PDF content with LLM-powered answers.
- Everything runs in **one script** â€“ no additional parser files needed.
- Streamlit-based user interface.
